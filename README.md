## Further details for Statistical Evaluation and Algorithms
Our [addendum](statistics_addendum.pdf) provides further details about useful algorithms to evaluate fuzzer campaigns.  

## Scripts for Statistical Evaluation of Fuzzers

[statistics.R](./statistics.R) provides the R implementation of Algorithms 1 to 5 from our addendum. Run via `Rscript statistics.R`.
